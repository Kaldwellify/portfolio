        <p>Hello! My name is Kennedy Caldwell, I'm a front office administrative support specialist at Multicare Health Systems. As far as my background goes, I started out as a fry cook while I attended High School and the first two years of college, before transitioning into the medical field which I've been in for the last 5 years. In between those 5 years, I spent a year as a 911 dispatcher for the South Sound region.<br>
    I've spent a good amount of time doing different jobs but one thing I've always been passionate about has been computers and software. Ever since my father introduced me to his IBM Aptiva and showed me DOS, I've been intrigued and desired to learn how to code and program software and websites.</p>
